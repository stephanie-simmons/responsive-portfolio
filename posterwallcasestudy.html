            During journey mapping I identified opportunities for potential user delights within the app like allowing
            the user to
            update their preferences from many different channels within the app. I used the sequencing of steps on
            journey mapping
            to start thinking about content strategy and information architecture. When would the users add their
            interests? When
            would I present the Sync Apps value proposition within the design?

            Once I had a grasp of how I wanted to organize the content of our app I took pencil to paper and starting

            some different ideas for how the concept could come to life through design.

            Wireframes and Prototyping
        </h4>

        <p class="p-5">
            After sketching out a few different versions of my screens I took some selected sketches into Figma to see
            how they
            compared as digital iterations. The process of pushing pixels during wireframe creation allowed me to spot
            flaws in my
            design early on. To be frank, it was ugly. My first vision of how my main user flow might look was clunky
            and
            cartoonish, wasn’t intuitive and required far too much work for the user, I could already see choke points
            in the flow
            where users may up and leave the app, frustrated with the steps they needed to take to achieve their goals.
            ‍<br>
            With some further sketching, iterative digital versions, and guidance from my mentor on the Thinkful team I
            was able to
            refine my wireframes and build out versions that I felt ready to take into the branding portion of the
            design process.

            Branding

        <p class="p-5">
            I started my branding process with some Design Inspiration and a mood board. One thing that stood out to me
            in current
            music app designs is the use of deep colors and gradients that give the UI an almost futuristic look. I
            decided to
            pursue dark gradients with a color palette I built out using Synth Wave Art style and color psychology as my
            guide.

        <ul class="pr-5 pl-5 pb-5 ml-5">
            <li>
                I chose two analogous colors (a bright blue and purple) for the basis of the color scheme

            <li>
                I used a shade generator on both of the colors to build out a series of monochromatic accent colors to
                use in my design

            <li>
                Color Psychology: Blue shows faith, stability, and wisdom. Purple emits royalty, creativity, and mystery

                What mood are we trying to evoke with Sync? The core of the Sync Brand Identity/Personality is faithful,
                trusted, evokes
                inner wisdom, and creatively helps people to find stability. I want Sync to be mysterious and creative,
                unique and
                innovative while also being stable and soothing to users.

            Because I chose such a color heavy UI and employed the use of gradients, I knew I had to strike balance by
            incorporating
            a simple typeface for both headings and body copy. I wanted to use typography to keep the design sleek and
            achieve
            continuity with the emotions the Sync brand seeks to evoke, like trust and stability. I started by
            revisiting typography

                    I identified issues in my usability testing that I saw could have been avoided with a stronger
                    incorporation of
                    accessibility guidelines.

                    I spent some time looking over the WCAG 2.0 guidelines and seeing how I could ensure the use
                    accessibility in the design
                    and development phases of the project.
