            I evaluated user psychographics against the universal archetypes and I identified three main archetypes that represent
            our user base for poster wall

            <br>
            I developed personas out of these archetypes to work with during experience mapping.

            I would do things differently next time at this point in my process and put in more effort to drive contact with the

            I also asked qualitative questions about how users felt about the app and how they would describe it. Here’s what I

            Overall users enjoyed the intuitive design and were able to navigate the app with ease

                    I quickly sketched and drew up wireframes of a new homepage that focused more on One Fair Wage at the clients request. I
                    was able to conduct some impromptu guerilla usability tests to test the new layout.

            Learnings

        <p class="p-5">
            This design exercise taught me an abundance of valuable lessons.

            <br>
            <span class="font-weight-bold">
                so What did I learn?

        <ul class="ml-5 mr-5">
            <li>
                Share earlier and more often - I would spend more time with my client!
            </li>
            <li>
                More in-depth client interviews - I would ask more questions!
            </li>
            <li>
                Narrower scope - I would tackle a much smaller project next time as a new designer
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="p-5">
            As a student designer, this project taught me how to navigate a new design process. The sprint was able to reveal the
            gaps in my process and the areas in which I need to improve.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also discovered the joy of conducting research in my own community. I enjoyed the opportunity to find new ways to
            contribute to and hopefully give back to an environment that has helped nurture my own growth.
            <br>
            <br>
            This project showed me how truly rewarding UX work can be when designing solutions for those who share the space that
            you call home.
