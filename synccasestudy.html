                The Problem
            </h4>
            <p>
                Plenty of mood playlists are on the market, but with less than personal curation, these playlists don’t always seem to
                satisfy users needs.

                The Solution
            </h4>
            <p>
                Designed with a focus on the user's current emotion, Sync curates playlists to match or alter the users mood based
                on
                their specific musical taste, combining intention and personalization to bring the user a truly unique listening
                experience.

        Process
    </h2>

    <h3 class="p-5">
        Research and discovery
    </h3>

    <p class="p-5">
        During a 3 week Double Diamond design process I employed a variety of research methods to design the information
        architecture and influence the branding guidelines of the Sync App.
    </p>

    <h4 class="p-5">
        Literature Review
    </h4>

    <p class="p-5">
        The core idea for Sync was based on the assumption that music and emotion are inextricably linked, and that music is
        more than just beautiful sounds, but a tool and even a coping mechanism. I wanted to see what the world of Psychology
        had to say about the ties between music and emotion.
    </p>

    <h5 class="p-5">
        Key Discoveries:
    </h5>

    <ol>
        <li class="p-5">
            <strong>People use music as a tool for emotional regulation</strong>
            <br>
             "People use music in their everyday lives to regulate, enhance, and diminish undesirable emotional states" - Shahram
             Heshmat Ph.D.
        </li>
        <li class="p-5">
            <strong>Listening to “sad” music can help people cope with sadness in their own lives</strong>
            <br>
            “People use music to achieve various goals.. for instance, sad music enables the listener to disengage from the
            distressing situations.. and focus instead on the the beauty of the music"- Shahram Heshmat Ph.D.
        </li>
        <li class="p-5">
            <strong>Heightened emotions can impair the ability to effectively choose the right music</strong>
            <br>
            “Other studies confirm the fact that people with depression are not always able to effectively select music that helps
            them to feel better” -Music Use for Mood Regulation
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4 class="p-5">
        Surveys
    </h4>

    <p class="p-5">
        I wanted to understand how the experiences of real users measured up against my initial research. Did sad music help
        them cope? Did they ever find themselves at a loss of what to listen to? I wanted to hear it in their own words.
        Conducting user surveys allowed me to define a target audience, validate assumptions, and create a network of potential
        participants with whom to conduct further research.

    Competitive Analysis - Spotify and Apple Music
</h4>

<p class="p-5">
    Honestly these apps are top of the line. Spotify dominates the market, retaining 36% of music streaming app subscribers
    compared to Apple Music's 19% and Amazon Music's 12%. I conducted a market analysis and SWOT analysis of Apple Music and
    Spotify to gather inspiration and insights, and to pick up on common UI Patterns used in popular music apps, to ensure a
    design of the Sync App that stays true to the users mental model of a mobile streaming service.
</p>

<img src="images/spotify.png" alt="" class="p-5">
<img src="images/apple-music.png" alt="" class="p-5">

<p class="font-weight-bold p-5">
    Key Discoveries:
</p>

<ol class="p-5">
    <li>
        These apps are popular and solid, with a devastatingly loyal customer base. How could I make my product marketable with
        such well established giants on the market? I knew I had to find a way to differentiate Sync on the market to even stand
        a chance in a competition with a giant like Spotify.
    </li>
    <li>
        Although Spotify and Apple music both offer mood based playlists, these are pre-built playlists to match preset
        emotions. This presented me with an opportunity to identify the Sync Apps main differentiator, combining the common idea
        of mood based playlists with personalized content and marketing the Apps main function as an intentional and mindful
        listening experience.
    </li>
</ol>

<p class="font-weight-bold p-5">
    “However, the mood playlists do not always deliver the desired effect for participants, as the music contained within
    the mood playlists does not necessarily deliver on participant’s own taste, or their expectation around the music’s
    appropriateness for the desired mood." - Medium
</p>

<h4 class="p-5">
    Proto Persona
</h4>

<p class="p-5">
    While I was coordinating with participants for more in depth, qualitative interviews, I went through a basic journey
    mapping exercise with a proto-persona developed based on survey data.
</p>

<img src="images/elaine.png" alt="" class="p-5">

<p class="p-5">
    Based on assumptions, surveys, and initial research I tried to imagine what pain points might present themselves in this
    use case, like unsatisfactory content curation and emotional overwhelm that affects the users personal life and
    engagement with music.
</p>

<img src="images/elaine-journey.png" alt="" class="p-5">

<h4 class="p-5">
    User Interviews
</h4>

<p class="p-5 font-weight-bold">
    I aimed to interview participants in the 18-45 age range that found a high level of connection between mood and emotion
    and used Spotify or other streaming services.
</p>
<p class="p-5">
    To facilitate these interviews I set up an account with Calendly and sent an outreach email to identified survey
    participants allowing them to self schedule on my calendar. In the end I had the privilege of conducting six remote user
    interviews over Zoom. Through this process I was able to get a wholistic and in depth picture of the musical landscape
    that our users navigate, and how emotion serves to influence that landscape.

    In short, I found that users in our target audience faced the same experiences and challenges that I had identified in
    my initial review of psychology journals
</p>
<p class="p-5">
    <span class="font-weight-bold">Mood affects peoples musical choices</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    “I’m pretty conscious, if I'm going to play a certain artist I'll even change my mind on which album to play depending
    on my mood. I would honestly say that influencing my own mood can sometimes be a motivator for the music I pick” - Henry
</p>
<p class="p-5">
    <span class="font-weight-bold">Choosing music can be daunting at times:</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    “If I'm feeling kind of weird I might not listen to music because it’s too much work… the idea of going in and deciding
    what to pick is kind of like I don’t want to think about it” - Rei
</p>
<p class="p-5">
    <span class="font-weight-bold">Listening to sad music can be beneficial during a difficult time:</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    "It doesn’t align with how I'm seeing the world in that moment I guess, and it does make me feel more like alienated in
    that feeling or like it makes me feel guilty for lack of a better word. It’s invalidating to listen to something
    cheerful when I’m sad or upset” - Janelle
</p>

<h4 class="p-5">
    Personas and Journey Mapping
</h4>

<p class="p-5">
    I used the qualitative insights gathered during user interviews in combination with survey data and proto-persona
    generation to develop out a few more fully formed personas to embody the target audience of the Sync App and guide me
    through journey mapping

    Experience Mapping
</h4>

<p class="p-5">
    During journey mapping I identified opportunities for potential user delights within the app like allowing the user to
    update their preferences from many different channels within the app. I used the sequencing of steps on journey mapping
    to start thinking about content strategy and information architecture. When would the users add their interests? When
    would I present the Sync Apps value proposition within the design?

    Site Map
</h4>
<p class="p-5">
    Once I had iterated on user flows I started to think more about which screens I would need to design for the users to
    achieve their goals (complete their tasks) and how these screens might need to interact. I used a card sort conducted
    through Optimal Workshop to drive the organization of content across the screens of the app.

    Ideas and Solutions
</h3>

<p class="p-5">
    Once I had a grasp of how I wanted to organize the content of our app I took pencil to paper and starting working out
    some different ideas for how the concept could come to life through design.
</p>

<h4 class="p-5">
    Sketching
</h4>

<h4 class="p-5">
    Wireframes and Prototyping
</h4>

<p class="p-5">
    After sketching out a few different versions of my screens I took some selected sketches into Figma to see how they
    compared as digital iterations. The process of pushing pixels during wireframe creation allowed me to spot flaws in my
    design early on. To be frank, it was ugly. My first vision of how my main user flow might look was clunky and
    cartoonish, wasn’t intuitive and required far too much work for the user, I could already see choke points in the flow
    where users may up and leave the app, frustrated with the steps they needed to take to achieve their goals.
    ‍<br>
    With some further sketching, iterative digital versions, and guidance from my mentor on the Thinkful team I was able to
    refine my wireframes and build out versions that I felt ready to take into the branding portion of the design process.
    ‍<br>
    So, what changed?

    Branding
</h4>

<p class="p-5">
    I started my branding process with some Design Inspiration and a mood board. One thing that stood out to me in current
    music app designs is the use of deep colors and gradients that give the UI an almost futuristic look. I decided to
    pursue dark gradients with a color palette I built out using Synth Wave Art style and color psychology as my guide.

    Mood Board

<p class="font-weight-bold p-5">
    Color Palette
</p>

<ul class="pr-5 pl-5">
    <li>
        I chose two analogous colors (a bright blue and purple) for the basis of the color scheme
    </li>
    <li>
        I used a shade generator on both of the colors to build out a series of monochromatic accent colors to use in my design
    </li>
    <li>
        Color Psychology: Blue shows faith, stability, and wisdom. Purple emits royalty, creativity, and mystery
    </li>
    <li>
        What mood are we trying to evoke with Sync? The core of the Sync Brand Identity/Personality is faithful, trusted, evokes
        inner wisdom, and creatively helps people to find stability. I want Sync to be mysterious and creative, unique and
        innovative while also being stable and soothing to users.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="p-5">
    Typography
</h4>

<p class="pr-5 pl-5">
    Because I chose such a color heavy UI and employed the use of gradients, I knew I had to strike balance by incorporating
    a simple typeface for both headings and body copy. I wanted to use typography to keep the design sleek and achieve
    continuity with the emotions the Sync brand seeks to evoke, like trust and stability. I started by revisiting typography
